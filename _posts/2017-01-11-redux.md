title: Redux:predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
---
What is Redux?Redux provides a state container for JavaScript applications that will help your applications behave consistently.Using Redux we can represent whole state of the application as a single JavaScript object.

<h2>Three Principles of Redux</h2>

<pre>
1.Immutable State Tree
2.State tree is readonly
3.The Reducer
<pre>

<h3>State Tree</h3>
Everything that changes in a JavaScript application including data or complex UI state is contained with in a Single JavaScript Object called state or state tree.

<h3>State tree is readonly</h3>
Yes,state is readonly.We can't modify it or write it.Instead any time you want to change the state you need to dispatch an action.An action is also a plain JavaScript Object describing the state.Just like state is the minimum representation of the data in the app,the action is the minimum representation of the change to that data.We can use any structure in our action object.The only requirement is that it has a type property which is not undefined.

<h3>The Reducer</h3>

<p>To describe State mutation you have to write a pure function, that's take previous state of the application,the action being dispatched and returns next state of the application.This function is called the Reducer.So, What is pure function? Pure function are the functions whose returns value depends only on the values of arguments.Pure functions are predictable.It doesn't have any absorbable side effects such as network or database calls.Pure functions do not modify the values pass to them

<h3>Example</h3>

<div class='code'>
<pre>
//Pure functions
function square(x)
{
return x*x;
}

function squareAll(items)
{
return items.map(square)
}

//Impure functions
function square(x)
{
updateXIndatabase();
return x*x
}
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example:Create a simple Redux Application</h3>

<p>From this example we will learn about Redux Store and its three important methods getState(),dispatch(), and subscribe()</p>

<div class='code'>
<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>Redux</title>
  <script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/redux/3.6.0/redux.js'></script>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

</pre>
</div>


<div class='code'>
<pre>

const counter=(state=0,action)=>
{
  switch(action.type)
    {
      case "INCREMENT":
        return state+1;
        
      case "DECREMENT":
        return state-1;
       
      default:
        return state
    }
}


const {createStore}=Redux;
const store=createStore(counter);

const render=()=>{
  document.body.innerText=store.getState()
}
store.subscribe(render);
render();

document.addEventListener('click',()=>{  
  store.dispatch({type:'INCREMENT'});
  
})
</div>


 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
Redux helps us to write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.We can use redux with any library(React.js,Angular 2,jquery etc)
